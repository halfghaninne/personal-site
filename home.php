              I'm a programmer with a passion for work that has real-world impact.

            <p>
              Currently, I build product at Newsela, a company focused on fostering literacy by tailoring real-world content to students' individual reading levels.

              I came to coding after an award-winning career in journalism, where I structured online conversations around international politics.

              Now in tech, I'm ever-learning new programming techniques and technologies and pride myself on the usefulness and philosophical integrity of my work. In the past four years, I've worked on a variety of modern web stacks, from an open-source design system in React to a greenfield Rails application to help code schools better track student outcomes.

              When I'm not thinking about good object-oriented programming patterns, I spend a lot of time thinking about secular space and discourse, bias detection, and the ethics of communicating "othered" experiences.
