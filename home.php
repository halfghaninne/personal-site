              I'm a programmer and coding instructor who believes in bringing my full self to work.

            <p>
              In the past four years, I've worked on a variety of modern web stacks, from an open-source design system in React to a greenfield Rails application to help code schools better track student outcomes. I pride myself on the philosophical integrity of my work and am always interested in contributing to technical projects rooted in intention and community.
